1. Check for Palindrome: Write a function that takes a string as input and returns true if it is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards), and false otherwise.

2. Find the Longest Word: Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the longest word in the string. If there are multiple longest words, return the first one.

3. Count the Vowels: Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in the string.

5. Fibonacci Sequence: Write a function that takes a number n as input and returns the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding numbers (e.g., 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...).

6. Find the Missing Number: Write a function that takes an array of numbers from 1 to n, but one number is missing, and returns the missing number.

7. Reverse Words in a Sentence: Write a function that takes a sentence as input and returns the sentence with the order of words reversed.

8. Check for Anagrams: Write a function that takes two strings as input and returns true if they are anagrams (contain the same characters in a different order), and false otherwise.

9. Remove Duplicates: Write a function that takes an array of numbers or strings as input and returns a new array with duplicates removed.

10. Find the Maximum Difference: Write a function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns the maximum difference between any two numbers in the array.

11. Title Case a Sentence: Write a function that takes a sentence as input and returns the sentence with the first letter of each word capitalized and the rest of the word in lowercase.

12. Find the Second Largest Number: Write a function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns the second largest number in the array.

13. FizzBuzz: Write a function that prints numbers from 1 to n. For multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for multiples of 5, print "Buzz". For numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".

14. Check Prime Number: Write a function that takes a number as input and returns true if the number is a prime number, and false otherwise.

15. Chunk Array: Write a function that takes an array and a chunk size as input and returns an array of smaller arrays of the given chunk size.

16. Reverse an Integer: Write a function that takes an integer as input and returns the integer in reverse order. For example, 1234 should become 4321.

17. Find Missing Element: Write a function that takes two arrays, where one array is a shuffled version of the other, with one element missing. Return the missing element.

18. Merge Sorted Arrays: Write a function that takes two sorted arrays as input and merges them into a single sorted array.

19. Sort Characters in a String: Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the string with its characters sorted in alphabetical order.

20. Find Duplicate Element: Write a function that takes an array as input and returns the first duplicate element found in the array.

21. Check Armstrong Number: Write a function that takes a number as input and returns true if it is an Armstrong number, and false otherwise. An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

22. Find Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters: Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

23. Binary Search: Write a function that performs a binary search on a sorted array and returns the index of the target element. If the element is not found, return -1.

24. Caesar Cipher: Write a function that takes a string and a shift value as input and returns the string with each letter shifted by the given value according to the Caesar cipher. For example, with a shift of 3, "ABC" should become "DEF".

25. Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit: Write a function that takes a temperature in Celsius as input and returns the temperature in Fahrenheit.

26. Find Intersection of Two Arrays: Write a function that takes two arrays as input and returns an array containing their intersection (common elements).

27. Find Maximum Product of Two Integers in an Array: Write a function that takes an array of integers as input and returns the maximum product that can be obtained by multiplying any two integers from the array.

28. Find Longest Consecutive Subsequence: Write a function that takes an array of integers as input and returns the length of the longest consecutive subsequence (sequence with consecutive integers).

29. URLify a String: Write a function that takes a string as input and replaces all spaces with %20, similar to URL encoding.

30. Sum All Primes: Write a function that takes a number as input and returns the sum of all prime numbers less than or equal to that number.
